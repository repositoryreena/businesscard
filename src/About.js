        <small>My name is Reena, and I am a front-end developer. I graduated with a BS in Cognitive Science, and I recently obtained a certification in General Assembly's Software Engineer Bootcamp.
        If you're seeking a web developer who can utilize React, I'd love to discuss how I can contribute to your project.</small>
